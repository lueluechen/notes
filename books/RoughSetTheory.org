** Introduction
*** Fuzzy Sets
*** Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets
    the membership and nonmembership values of an element with respect to a
    collection of elements from a universe may not add up to 1 in all possible
    cases   

    #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
    #+BEGIN_definition
    An /intuitionistic fuzzy set/ $A$ on a universe $U$ is defined by two
    functions: /membership function/ $\mu_A$ and /non-membership function/ \nu s.t.
    \begin{equation*}
    \mu_A, \nu_A: U\to [0,1]
    \end{equation*}
    where $0\le \mu_A(x)+\nu_A(x)\le 1$ for all $x\in U$.
    #+END_definition

    The /hesitation function/ $\Pi_A$ for an intuitionistic fuzzy set is given by
    \begin{equation*}
    \Pi_A(x)=1-\mu_A(x)-\nu_A(x)
    \end{equation*}

    $\fR(\alpha)$ and we call the associated space $\bK(\alpha)=(U,\fR(\alpha))$ as the 
    /generated approximation space/ corresponding to $\bK$ and \alpha

    $\alpha\textit{-superfluous}$ in $\fR$ if and only if 
    $IND(\fR(\alpha))=IND(\fR(\alpha)-R(\alpha))$

** Introduction
    Granular computing is an emerging field of study focusing on structured
    thinking, structured problem solving and structured information processing
    with multiple levels of granularity 

    A primitive notion of granular computing is that of granules. Granules may
    be considered as parts of a whole. A granule may be understood as a unit
    that we use for describing and representing a problem or a focal point of
    our attention at a specific point of time. Granules can be organized based
    on their inherent properties and interrelationships. The results are a
    multilevel granular structure. Each level is populated by granules of the
    similar size or the similar nature. Depending on a particular context,
    levels of granularity may be interpreted as levels of abstraction, levels of
    details, levels of processing, levels of understanding, levels of
    interpretation, levels of control, and many more. An ordering of levels
    based on granularity provides a hierarchical granular structure. 
** Granular spaces
*** A Set-theoretic interpretation of granules
    Categorization or classification is one of the fundamental tasks of human
    intelligence.

    The process of categorization covers two important issues of granulation,
    namely, the construction of granules and the naming of granules. Objects in the
    same categories must be more similar to each other, and objects in different
    granules are more dissimilar to each other.
*** A formulation of granules as concept
    The classical view of concepts defines a concept jointly by a set of
    objects, called the extension of the concept, and a set of intrinsic
    properties common to the set of objects, called the intension of the
    concept. Typically, the name of a concept reflects the intension of a
    concept. The extension of a concept is the set of objects which are concrete
    examples of a concept. One may introduce a logic language so that the
    intension of a concept is represented by a formula and the extension is
    represented by the set of objects satisfying the formula.

    For an individual $x\in U$, if it satisfies an atomic formula $p$, we write
    $x\models p$. An individual satisfies a formula if the individual has the
    properties as specified by the formula.

    If $\phi$ is a formula, the set $m(\phi)$ defined by
    \begin{equation*}
    m(\phi)=\lb x\in U\mid x\models \phi\rb
    \end{equation*}
    is called the /meaning/ of the formula \phi. In other words, \phi can be
    viewed as the description of the set of object $m(\phi)$. As a result, a
    concept can be expressed by a pair $(\phi,m(\phi))$ where $\phi\in\call$.
    \phi is the intension of a concept while $m(\phi)$ is the extension of a concept.
*** Granular spaces and granular structures
    Each atomic formula in $\cala$ is associated with a subset of $U$. This
    subset may be viewed as an elementary granule in $U$. Each formula is
    obtained by taking logic operations on atomic formulas. The meaning set of
    the formula can be obtained from the elementary granules through
    set-theoretic operations

    A subset or a granule $X\subseteq U$ is /definable/ if and only if there
    exists a formula \phi in the language $\call$ s.t.
    \begin{equation*}
    X=m(\phi)
    \end{equation*}
    Family of all definable granules is given by
    \begin{equation*}
    Def(\call(\cala,\lb\neg,\wedge,\vee\rb,U))=\lb m(\phi)\mid\phi\in\call
    (\cala,\lb\neg,\wedge,\vee\rb,U)\rb
    \end{equation*}
    which is a subsystem of the power set $2^U$ closed under set complement,
    intersection and union. A /granular space/
    \begin{equation*}
    (U,\cals_0,\cals)
    \end{equation*}
    where $U$ is the universe, $\cals_0\subseteq 2^U$ is a family of elementary
    granules, i.e., $\cals_0=\lb m(p)\mid p\in\cala\rb$, $\cals\subseteq 2^U$ is
    a family of definbale granules

    $\cals$ is an $\sigma\text{-algebra}$
** Rough Set Analysis
*** Granular spaces and granular structures
    Information table
    \begin{equation*}
    M=(U,At,\lb V_a\mid a\in At\rb,\lb I_a\mid a\in At\rb)
    \end{equation*}
    where $I_a:U\to V_a$ is an information function.
    
    For a set of attributes $P\subseteq At$, we can define an equivalence
    relation on the set of objects
    \begin{equation*}
    xE_py\Longleftrightarrow\forall a\in P(I_a(x)=I_a(y))
    \end{equation*}
    
    By taking the union of a family of equivalence classes, we can obtain a
    composite granule. The family of all such granules contains the entire set $U$
    and the empty set $\emptyset$, and is closed under set complement,
    intersection and 
    union. More specifically, the family is an \sigma-algebra, denoted by $\sigma(U/E)$,
    with the basis $U/E$

    For an attribute-value pair $(a,v)$ ,where $a\in At, v\in V_a$, we have an
    atomic formula $a=v$. The meaning of $a=v$ is
    \begin{equation*}
    m(a=v)=\lb x\in U\mid I_a(x)=v\rb
    \end{equation*}
    Hence $[x]=\bigvee_{a\in At}a=I_a(x)$ and is a definable granule.
*** Rough Set Approximation
    \begin{align*}
      &\underline{apr}(A)=\bigcup\lb X\in\sigma(U/E)\mid X\subseteq A\rb\\
      &\overline{apr}(A)=\bigcap\lb X\in\sigma(U/E)\mid A\subseteq X\rb\\
    \end{align*}
    Hence $(\underline{apr}(A),\overline{apr}(A))$ is the tightest approximation.
** Knowledge space theory
   In knowledge spaces, we consider a pair $(Q,\calk)$ where $Q$ is a finite set
   of questions and $\calk\subseteq 2^Q$. Each $K\subseteq\calk$ is called a
   /knowledge state/ and \(\calk\) is the set of all possible knowledge state.


   Intuitively, the knowledge state of an individual is represented by the set
   of questions that he is capable of answering. Each knowledge state can be
   considered as a granule. The collection of all the knowledge states together
   with the empty set ∅ and the whole set $Q$ is called a knowledge structure, and
   may be viewed as a granular knowledge structure in the terminology of
   granular computing 
*** Granular spaces associated to surmise relations
    A surmise relation on the set $Q$ of questions is a reflexive and transitive
    relation $S$. By $aSb$, we can surmise the mastery of $a$ if a student can
    correctly question $b$. For example, $aSb$ means that if a knowledge state
    contains $b$, it must also contain $a$.

    Formally, for a surmise relation $S$ on the finite set $Q$ of questions, the
    associated knowledge structure $\calk$ is defined by
    \begin{equation*}
    \calk=\lb K\mid\forall q,q'\in Q((qSq',q'\in K)\Rightarrow q\in K)\rb
    \end{equation*}

    For each question $q$ in $Q$, under a surmise relation, we can find a unique
    prerequistie question set $R_p(q)=\lb q'\mid q'Sq\rb$. The family of the
    prerequistie question sets for all the questions is denoted by $\calb$. By taking
    the union of prerequisite sets for a family of questions, we can obtain a
    knowledge structure $\calk$ associated to the surmise relation $S$. It
    defines a granular space $(Q,\calb,\calk)$. All knowledge states are called
    granules in $(Q,\calb,\calk)$.

     When dealing with attributes in concept classification and prediction, it
     is obvious that they may have varying importance in the problem being
     considered. Their importance can be pre-assumed using auxiliary knowledge
     about the problem and expressed by properly chosen weights. However, in the
     case of using the rough set approach to concept classification and
     prediction, it avoids any additional information aside from what is
     included in the information table itself. Basically, the rough set approach
     tries to determine from the data available in the information table whether
     all the attributes are of the same strength and, if not, how they differ in
     respect of the classifier power.
