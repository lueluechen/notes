* Preliminaries

** Structures
   *Vocabularies* are finite sets that consist of *relation symbols* and
   *constant symbols*. We denote vocabularies by \tau, \sigma,\(\dots\). A
   *vocabulary* is relational if it does not contain constants.


*** Graph
   Let \(\tau=\{E\}\) with a binary relation symbol \(E\). A *graph* (or
   *undirected graph*) is a \tau-structure \(\calg=(G,E^G)\) satisfying
   1. for all \(a\in G\): not \(E^Gaa\)
   2. for all \(a,b\in G\): if \(E^Gab\) then \(E^Gba\)


   By GRAPH we denote the class of *finite* graphs. If only (1) is required, we
   speak of a *digraph*

   A subset \(X\) of the universe of a graph \(\calg\) is a *clique*, if
   \(E^Gab\) for all \(a,b\in X\), \(a\neq b\)


   Let \(\calg\) be a digraph. If \(n\ge1\) and
   \begin{equation*}
   E^Ga_0a_1,E^Ga_1a_2,\dots,E^Ga_{n-1}a_n
   \end{equation*}
   then \(a_0,\dots,a_n\) is a *path* from \(a_0\) to \(a_n\) of *length* \(n\).
   If \(a_0=a_n\), then \(a_0,\dots,a_n\) is a *cycle*. A path \(a_0,\dots,a_n\)
   is *Hamiltonian* if \(G=\{a_0,\dots,a_n\}\) and \(a_i\neq a_j\) for
   \(i\neq j\). If, in addition, \(E^Ga_na_0\) we speak of a *Hamiltonian
   circuit*

   Let \(\calg\) be a graph. Write \(a\sim b\) if \(a=b\) or if there is a path
   from \(a\) to \(b\). The equivalence class of \(a\) is called the
   *(connected) component* of \(a\). Let CONN be the class of finite connected
   graphs

   Denote by \(d(a,b)\) the length of a shortest path from \(a\) to \(b\); more
   precisely, define the *distance function* \(d:G\times G\to\N\cup\{\infty\}\)
   by
   \begin{equation*}
   d(a,b)=\infty\text{ iff }a\not\sim b,\quad d(a,b)=0\text{ iff }a=b
   \end{equation*}
   and otherwise
   \begin{equation*}
   d(a,b)=\min\{n\ge1\mid\text{there is a path from $a$ to $b$ of length $n$}\}
   \end{equation*}

   We give the following definitions only for *finite* digraphs. A vertex \(b\)
   is a successor of a vertex \(a\) if \(E^Gab\). The *in-degree* of a vertex is
   the number of its predecessors, the *out-degree* the number of its
   successors.

   A *root* of a digraph is a vertex with in-degree 0 and a *leaf* a vertex with
   out-degree 0.

   A *forest* is an acyclic digraph where each vertex has in-degree at most 1. A
   *tree* is a forest with connected underlying graph. Let TREE be the class of
   finite trees.

*** Operations on Structures
    Two \(\tau\)-structures \(\cala\) and \(\calb\) are *isomorphic*, written \(\calc\cong\calb\), if
    there is an isomorphism from \(\cala\) to \(\calb\), i.e., a bijection \(\pi:A\to B\) preserving
    relations and constants, that is
    - for \(n\)-ary \(R\in \tau\) and \(a_1,\dots,a_n\in A\)
      \begin{equation*}
      R^Aa_1\dots a_n \quad\text{ iff }\quad
      R^B\pi(a_i)\dots\pi(a_n)
      \end{equation*}
    - for \(c\in\tau\), \(\pi(c^A)=\pi(c^B)\)


    For relational \tau we introduce the *union* (or, *disjoint union*) of structures. Assume
    that \(\cala\) and \(\calb\) are \(\tau\)-structures with \(A\cap B=\emptyset\).
    Then \(\cala\dot{\cup}\calb\), the *union* of \(\cala\) and \(\calb\), is the \(\tau\)-structure
    with domain \(A\cup B\) and
    \begin{equation*}
    R^{\cala\dot\cup\calb}:=R^{\cala}\cup R^{\cala}
    \end{equation*}
    for any \(R\) in \tau

    Note that the union of ordered structures is not an ordered structure. The situation is
    different for the so-called *ordered sum*: let \(\tau\) with \(<\in\tau\) be relational and
    let \(\cala\) and \(\calb\) be ordered \(\tau\)-structures. Assume that \(A\cap B=\emptyset\).
    Define \(\cala\lhd\calb\), the *ordered sum* of \(\cala\) and \(\calb\) as \(\cala\dot\cup\calb\)
    but setting
    \begin{equation*}
    <^{\cala\dot\cup\calb}:=<^{\cala}\cup <^{\calb}\cup
    \{(a,b)\mid a\in A,b\in B\}
    \end{equation*}
** Syntax and Semantics of First-Order Logic
   Fix a vocabulary \tau. Each formula of first-order logic will be a string of symbols taken from the
   alphabet consisting of
   - variables
   - connectives
   - existential quantifier
   - equality symbol
   - )(
   - the symbols in \tau
   
    Denote \(\FO[\tau]\) the set of formulas of first-order logic of vocabulary
    \tau.

    The axioms for graphs stated above have the following formalizations in \(\FO[\{E\}]\)
    \begin{align*}
    &\forall x\neg Exx\\
    &\forall x\forall y(Exy\to Eyx)
    \end{align*}

    When only taking into consideration finite structures, we use the notation
    \(\Phi\models_{\fin}\psi\)

    The *quantifier rank* \(\qr(\varphi)\) of a formula \varphi is the maximum
    number of nested quantifiers occurring in it

    It can be shown that every first-order formula is logically equivlent to a
    formula in prenex normal form, that is, to a formula of the form
    \(Q_1x_1,\dots,Q_sx_s\psi\) where \(Q_1,\dots,Q_s\in\{\forall,\exists\}\),
    and where \psi is quantifier-free. Such a formula is called \(\Sigma_n\) if
    the string of \(n\) consecutive blocks, where in each block all quantifiers
    all of the same type, adjacent blocks contain quantifiers of different type,
    and the first block is existential. \(\Pi_n\) formulas are defined in the
    same way but now we require that the first block consists of universal
    quantifiers. A \(\Delta_n\)-formula is a formula logically equivalent to
    both a \(\Sigma_n\)-formula and a \(\Pi_n\)-formula

    Given a formula \(\varphi(x,\overbar{z})\) and \(n\ge1\),
    \begin{equation*}
    \exists^{\ge n}x\varphi(x,\overbar{z})
    \end{equation*}
    is an abbreviation for the formula
    \begin{equation*}
    \exists x_1,\dots\exists x_n(
    \bigwedge_{1\le i\le n}\varphi(x_i,\overbar{z})\wedge
    \bigwedge_{1\le i<j\le n}\neg x_i=x_j)
    \end{equation*}

    We set
    \begin{equation*}
    \varphi_{\ge n}:=\exists^{\ge n}x\;x=x
    \end{equation*}
    Clearly
    \begin{equation*}
    \cala\models\varphi_{\ge n}\quad\text{ iff }\quad\norm{A}\ge n
    \end{equation*}

** Some Classical Results of First-Order Logic

    The set of logically valid sentences of first-order logic is r.e.

    #+BEGIN_theorem
    label:thm1.0.3
    \Phi is satisfiable iff every finite subset of \Phi is satisfiable
    #+END_theorem

    Neither Theorem ref:thm1.0.2 nor ref:thm1.0.3 remain valid if one only
    considers finite structures. A counterexample for the Compactness Theorem is
    given by the set \(\Phi_\infty:=\{\varphi_{\ge n}\mid n\ge1\}\): Each finite
    subset of \(\Phi_\infty\) has a finite model, but \(\Phi_\infty\) has no
    finite model

    The failure of Theorem ref:thm1.0.2 is documented by
    #+ATTR_LATEX: :options [Trahtenbrot's Theorem]
    #+BEGIN_theorem
    The set of sentences of first-order logic valid in all finite structures is

    #+BEGIN_lemma
    label:lemma1.0.6
    Let \(\varphi\in\FO[\tau]\) and for \(i\in I\), let
    \(\Phi^i\subseteq\FO[\tau]\). Assume that
    \begin{equation*}
    \models\varphi\leftrightarrow\bigvee_{i\in I}\bigwedge\Phi^i
    \end{equation*}
    Then there is a finite \(I_0\subseteq I\) and for every \(i\in I_0\), a
    finite \(\Phi^i_0\subseteq\Phi^i\) s.t.
    \begin{equation*}
    \models\varphi\leftrightarrow\bigvee_{i\in I_0}\bigwedge\Phi^i_0
    \end{equation*}
    #+END_lemma

    #+BEGIN_proof
    For simplicity we assume that \varphi is a sentence and that every
    \(\Phi^i\) is a set of sentences. By hypothesis, for some \(i\in I\), we
    have \(\Phi^i\models\varphi\); hence, by the Compactness Theorem,
    \(\Phi^i_0\models\varphi\) for some finite \(\Phi^i_0\subseteq\Phi^i\).

    If there is not such \(I_0\) with
    \(\models\varphi\to\bigvee_{i\in I_0}\bigwedge\Phi_0^i\), then each finite subset of
    \(\{\varphi\}\cup\{\neg\bigwedge\Phi^i_0\mid i\in I\}\) has a model. Hence by
    the Compactness Theorem, there is a contradiction

    #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
    #+BEGIN_corollary
    Let \Phi be a set of first-order sentences. Assume that any two structures
    that satisfy the same sentences of \Phi are elementarily equivalent. Then
    any first-order sentence is equivalent to a boolean combination of sentences
    of \Phi
    #+END_corollary

    #+BEGIN_proof
    For any structure \(\cala\) set
    \begin{equation*}
    \Phi(\cala):=\{\psi\mid\psi\in\Phi,\cala\models\psi\}\cup
    \{\neg\psi\mid\psi\in\Phi,\cala\models\neg\psi\}
    \end{equation*}
    Let \(\varphi\) be any first-order sentence. By the preceding lemma it
    suffices to show that
    \begin{equation*}
    \models\varphi\leftrightarrow\bigvee_{\cala\models\phi}\bigwedge\Phi(\cala)
    \end{equation*}
    If \(\calb\models\varphi\) then
    \(\calb\models\bigvee_{\cala\models\varphi}\bigwedge\Phi(\cala)\). Suppose
    \(\cala\models\bigvee_{\cala\models\varphi}\bigwedge\Phi(\cala)\). Then for
    some model \(\cala\) of \varphi, \(\calb\models\Phi(\cala)\). By the
    definition of \(\Phi(\cala)\), \(\cala\) and \(\calb\) satisfy the same
    sentences of \Phi
    #+END_proof

** Model Classes and Global Relations
    Fix a vocabulary \tau. For a sentence \varphi of \(\FO[\tau]\) we denote by
    \(\Mod(\varphi)\) the class of *finite* models of \varphi.

    \(\Mod(\varphi)\) is closed under isomorphisms

    For \(\varphi(x_1,\dots,x_n)\in\FO[\tau]\) and a structure \(\cala\) let
    \begin{equation*}
    \varphi^{\cala}(-):=\{(a_1,\dots,a_n)\mid\cala\models\varphi[a_1,\dots,a_n]\}
    \end{equation*}
    be the set of \(n\)-tuples *defined by \varphi in \(\cala\)*. For \(n=0\) this be read as
    \begin{equation*}
    \varphi^{\cala}:=
    \begin{cases}
    \text{TRUE}&\text{if }\cala\vDash\varphi\\
    \text{FALSE}&\text{if }\calb\not\vDash\varphi
    \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}

    Use this notation we have
    \begin{equation*}
    \text{if }\pi:\cala\cong\calb\text{ then }\pi(\varphi^{\cala}(-)=\varphi^{\calb}(-))
    \end{equation*}
    where for \(X\subseteq A^n\) we set \(\pi(X):=\{\pi(a_1),\dots,\pi(a_n)\mid (a_1,\dots,a_n)\in X\}\)

    *Throughout the book all classes \(K\) of structures considered will tacitly be assumed to be*
    *closed under isomorphisms*, i.e.
    \begin{equation*}
    \cala\in K \text{ and }\cala\cong\calb
    \text{ implies }\calb\in K
    \end{equation*}

    #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []

    Let \(K\) be a class of \(\tau\)-structures. An \(n\)-ary
    *global relation
    \Gamma on \(K\)* is a mapping assigning to each \(A\in K\) an \(n\)-ary
    relation \(\Gamma(\cala)\) on \(\cala\) satisfying
    \begin{equation*}
    \Gamma(\cala)a_1\dots a_n\quad\text{ iff }\quad\Gamma(\calb)\pi(a_1)\dots\pi(a_n)
    \end{equation*}
    for every isomorphism \(\pi:\cala\cong\calb\) and every
    \(a_1,\dots,a_n\in A\). If \(K\) is the class of all finite \(\tau\)-structures,
    then we just speak of an \(n\)-ary *global relation*

       \end{equation*}

    An important issue in model theory is the study of properties of classes of structures that are
    axiomatizable in a given logic \(\call\) and in particular to determine what classes of
    structures are axiomatizable are what global relations are definable in \(\call\).

   In general, a *partial isomorphism does not preserve the validity of formulas with quantifiers*:
   Let \(\tau=\{<\}\), \(\cala=(\{0,1,2\},<)\), \(\calb=(\{0,1,2,3\},<)\) whre in both cases <
   denotes the natural ordering. Then \(p_0:=02\mapsto 01\) is a partial isomorphism from \(\cala\)

   \cala\vDash\exists v_3(v_1<v_3\wedge v_3<v_2)[0,2]

   Let \(\cala\) and \(\calb\) be \(\tau\)-structures, \(\bar{a}\in A^s\),
   \(\overbar{b}\in B^s\), and \(m\in\N\). The *Ehrenfeucht game*
   \(G_m(\cala,\overbar{a},\calb,\overbar{b})\) is played by two players called
   the *spoiler* and the *duplicator*. Each player has to make \(m\) moves in
   the course of a play. In his \(i\)-th move the spoiler first selects a
   structure, \(\cala\) or \(\calb\), and an element in this structure. If the
   spoiler chooses \(e_i\) in \(\cala\) then the duplicator in his \(i\)-th move
   must choose an element \(f_i\) in \(\calb\). If the spoiler chooses \(f_i\)
   in \(\calb\) then the duplicator must choose an element \(e_i\) in \(\cala\)

   The duplicator *wins* iff
   \(\overbar{a}\overbar{e}\mapsto\overbar{b}\overbar{f}\in\Part(\cala,\calb)\).

   Equivalently, the spoiler wins if after
   some \(i\le m\), \(\bar{a}e_1\dots e_i\mapsto\bar{b}f_1\dots f_i\) is not a partial isomorphism.
   We say that a player, the spoiler or the duplicator, has a *winning strategy*
   in \(G_m(\cala,\bar{a},\calb,\bar{b})\), or shortly, that he
   *wins* \(G_m(\cala,\bar{a},\calb,\bar{b})\), if it is possible for him to win each play whatever
   choices are made by the opponent.

   Let \(\cala\) be given. For \(\bar{a}=a_1\dots a_s\in A\) and \(m\ge0\) we introduce a formula
   \(\varphi^m_{\bar{a}}(v_1,\dots,v_s)\) that describes the game-theoretic properties
   of \(\bar{a}\) in any game \(G_m(\cala,\bar{a},\dots)\) s.t. for any \(\calb\)
   and \(\bar{b}=b_1\dots b_s\in B\)
   \begin{equation*}
   \calb\vDash\varphi^m_{\bar{a}}[\bar{b}]

   \text{the duplicator wins }G_m(\cala,\bar{a},\calb,\bar{b})

   \(\varphi_{\bar{a}^0}\) describes the isomorphism type of the substructure generated
   by \(\bar{a}\) in \(\cala\); and for \(m>0\) the formula \(\varphi_{\bar{a}}^m\) tells us to
   which isomorphism types the tuple \(\bar{a}\) can be extended in \(m\) steps adding one element
   in each step. \(\varphi_{\bar{a}}^m\) is called the *\(m\)-isomorphism type* (or *\(m\)-Hintikka
