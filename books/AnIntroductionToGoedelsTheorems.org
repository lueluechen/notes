  #+BEGIN_theorem
  If \Sigma and also its complement \(\ove{\Sigma}\) are both effectively enumerable sets
  of numbers, then \Sigma is effectively decidable
  #+END_theorem

  #+BEGIN_proof
  Suppose \Sigma is enumerated by the effectively computable function \(f\) and
  \(\ove{\Sigma}\) by \(g\). Then compute in turn \(f(0),g(0),f(1),g(1),\dots\)
  #+END_proof

  The *numerical domain* of an algorithm \Pi is the set of natural numbers \(n\)
  s.t. when the algorithm \Pi is applied to the number \(n\) as input, then the
  run of the algorithm will eventually terminate and deliver some number as
  output

  #+BEGIN_theorem
  \(W\) is an effectively enumerable set of numbers if and only if it is the
  numerical domain of some algorithm \Pi
  #+END_theorem
