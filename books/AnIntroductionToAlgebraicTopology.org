* Introduction

** Notation
   \(\bI=[0,1]\).
   \begin{equation*}
   S^n=\{x\in\R^{n+1}\mid\norm{x}=1\}
   \end{equation*}
   \(S^n\) is called the *\(n\)-sphere*. \(S^n\subset\R^{n+1}\) (\(S^1\) is the circle); 0-sphere \(S^0\)
   consists of the two points \(\{-1,1\}\) and hence is a discrete two-point space. We may
   regard \(S^n\) as the *equator* of \(S^{n+1}\)
   \begin{equation*}
   S^n=\R^{n+1}\cap S^{n+1}=\{(x_1,\dots,x_{n+2})\in S^{n+1}:x_{n+2}=0\}
   \end{equation*}
   The *north pole* is \((0,0,\dots,0,1)\in S^n\); the *south pole* is \((0,0,\dots,0,-1)\). The *antipode*
   of \(x=(x_1,\dots,x_{n+1})\in S^n\) is the other endpoint of the diameter having one endpoint \(x\); thus
   the antipode of \(x\) is \(-x=(-x_1,\dots,-x_{n+1})\), for the distance from \(-x\) to \(x\) is 2.
   \begin{equation*}
   D^n=\{x\in\R^n\mid\norm{x}\le 1\}
   \end{equation*}
   \(D^n\) is called the *\(n\)-disk* (or *\(n\)-ball*).  Observe that \(S^{n-1}\subset D^n\subset \R^n\);
   indeed \(S^{n-1}\) is the boundary of \(D^n\) in \(\R^n\)
   \begin{equation*}
   \Delta^n=\{(x_1,\dots,x_{n+1})\in\R^{n+1}:\text{ each }x_i\ge 0\text{ and }\sum x_i=1\}
   \end{equation*}
   \(\Delta^n\) is called the *standard \(n\)-simplex*. \(\Delta^0\) is a point, \(\Delta^1\) is a closed
   interval, \(\Delta^2\) is a triangle (with interior), \(\Delta^3\) is a (solid) tetrahedron, and so on.

   There is a standard homeomorphism from \(S^n\) - {north pole} to \(\R^n\), called *stereographic
   projection*. Denote the north pole by \(N\), and define \(\sigma:S^n-\{N\}\to\R^n\) to be the intersection
   of \(\R^n\) and the line joining \(x\) and \(N\). Points on the latter line have the
   form \(tx+(1-t)N\), hence they have coordinates
   \((tx_1,\dots,tx_n,tx_{n+1}+(1-t))\). The last coordinate is zero for \(t=(1-x_{n+1})^{-1}\); hence
   \begin{equation*}
   \sigma(x)=(tx_1,\dots,tx_n)
   \end{equation*}
   where \(t=(1-x_{n+1})^{-1}\). It is now routine to check that \sigma is indeed a homeomorphism. Note
   that \(\sigma(x)=x\) iff \(x\) lies on the equator \(S^{n-1}\)

** Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem
   #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
   #+BEGIN_theorem
   Every continuous \(f:D^1\to D^1\) has a fixed point
   #+END_theorem

   #+BEGIN_proof
   Let \(f(-1)=a\) and \(f(1)=b\).If either \(f(-1)=-1\) or \(f(1)=1\), we are done. Therefore we
   may assume that \(f(-1)=a>-1\) and that \(f(1)=b<1\) as drawn.

   If \(G\) is the graph of \(f\) and \Delta is the graph of the identity function, then we must prove
   that \(G\cap\Delta\neq\emptyset\). The idea is to use a connectness argument to show that every path in \(D^1\times D^1\)
   from \(a\) to \(b\) must cross \Delta.

   Since \(f\) is continuous, \(G=\{(x,f(x)):x\in D^1\}\) is connected (continuous image of connected
   space is connected). Define \(A=\{(x,f(x)):f(x)>x\}\)  and \(B=\{(x,f(x)):f(x)<x\}\). Note
   that \(a\in A\) and \(b\in B\), so that \(A\neq\emptyset\) and \(B\neq\emptyset\). If \(G\cap\Delta=\emptyset\), then \(G\) is the disjoint
   union of \(A\) and \(B\).

   A subspace \(X\) of a topological space \(Y\) is a *retract* of \(Y\) if there is a continuous

   A category \(\calc\) consists of three ingredients: a class of *objects*, \(\obj\calc\); sets of
   *morphisms* \(\Hom(A,B)\), one for every ordered pair \(A,B\in\obj\calc\);
   *composition* \(\Hom(A,B)\times\Hom(B,C)\to\Hom(A,C)\), denoted by \((f,g)\to g\circ f\), for
   every \(A,B,C\in\obj\calc\) satisfying the following axioms
   1. the family of \(\Hom(A,B)\)'s is pairwise disjoint
   2. composition is associative when defined
   3. for each \(A\in\obj\calc\) there exists an identity \(1_A\in\Hom(A,A)\) satisfying \(1_A\circ f=f\) for
      every \(f\in\Hom(B,A)\), all \(B\in\obj\calc\) and \(g\circ 1_A=g\) for every \(g\in\Hom(A,C)\), all \(C\in\obj\calc\)

   Let \(\calc\) and \(\cala\) be categories with \(\obj\calc\subset\obj\cala\). If \(A,B\in\obj\calc\), let's denote the two
   possible Hom sets by \(\Hom_{\calc}(A,B)\) and \(\Hom_{\cala}(A,B)\). Then \(\calc\) is a *subcategory*
   of \(\cala\) if \(\Hom_{\calc}(A,B)\subset\Hom_{\cala}(A,B)\) for all \(A,B\in\obj\calc\) and if composition in \(\calc\) is

   \(\calc=\Top^{2}\). here \(\obj\calc\) consists of all ordered pairs \((X,A)\) where \(X\) is a topological

   it is called the category of *pointed spaces*; \(x_0\) is called the *basepoint* of \((X,x_0)\) and
   morphisms are called *pointed maps* (or *basepoint preserving maps*). The category \(\Sets_*\) of
   pointed sets is defined similarly

   and \(x\not\le y\), define \(\Hom(x,y)=\emptyset\); if \(x\le y\), define \(\Hom(x,y)\) to be a set with
   exactly one element, denoted by \(i_y^x\); if \(x\le y\le z\) define composition by \(i_z^y\circ i_y^x=i_z^x\)

   A *diagram* in a category \(\calc\) is a directed graph whose vertices are labeled by objects of \(\calc\) and

   Given a category \(\calc\), shows that the following construction gives a category \(\calm\). First, an
   object of \(\calm\) is a morphism of \(\calc\). Next, if \(f,g\in\obj\calm\), say \(f:A\to B\) and \(g:C\to D\),
   then a morphism in \(\calm\) is an ordered pair \((h,k)\) of morphisms in \(\calc\) s.t. the diagram

   #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
   #+BEGIN_definition
   A *congruence* on a category \(\calc\) is an equivalence relation \(\sim\) on the
   class \(\bigcup_{(A,B)}\Hom(A,B)\) of all morphisms in \(\calc\) s.t.
   1. \(f\in\Hom(A,B)\) and \(f\sim f'\) implies \(f'\in\Hom(A,B)\)
   2. \(f\sim f'\), \(g\sim g'\) and the composite \(g\circ f\) exists imply that
      \begin{equation*}
      g\circ f\sim g'\circ f'
      \end{equation*}
   #+END_definition

   #+BEGIN_theorem
   label:thm0.4
   Let \(\calc\) be a category with congruence \(\sim\) and let \([f]\) denote the equivalence class of a
   morphism \(f\). Define \(\calc'\) as follows
   \begin{align*}
   \obj\calc'&=\obj\calc\\
   \Hom_{\calc'}(A,B)&=\{[f]:f\in\Hom_{\calc}(A,B)\}\\
   [g]\circ[f]&=[g\circ f]
   \end{align*}
   Then \(\calc'\) is a category
   #+END_theorem

   #+BEGIN_proof
   Property 1 in the definition of congruence shows that \(\sim\) partitions each set \(\Hom_{\calc}(A,B)\)
   and this implies that \(\Hom_{\calc'}(A,B)\) is a set; moreover, the family of these sets is pairwise
   disjoint. Property 2 in the definition of congruence shows that composition in \(\calc'\) is
   well. \(\calc'\) is associative and \([1_A]\) is the identity is not hard
   #+END_proof

   The category \(\calc'\) is called a *quotient category* of \(\calc\); one usually
   denotes \(\Hom_{\calc'}(A,B)\) by \([A,B]\)

   Let \(\C\) denote the complex numbers, let \(\Sigma_\rho\subset\C\approx\R^2\) denote the circle with center at the origin
   0 and radius \rho, and let \(f_\rho^n:\Sigma_\rho\to\C-\{0\}\) denote the restriction to \(\Sigma^\rho\) of \(z\mapsto z^n\). If none
   of the maps \(f_\rho^n\) is nullhomotopic (\(n\ge 1\) and \(\rho>0\)) then the fundamental theorem of
   algebra is true (i.e., every nonconstant complex polynomial has a complex root)
   #+END_theorem

   #+BEGIN_proof
   Consider the polynomial with complex coefficients
   \begin{equation*}
   g(z)=z^n+a_{n-1}z^{n-1}+\dots+a_1z+a_0
   \end{equation*}
   Choose \(\rho>\max\{1,\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\abs{a_i}\}\) and define \(F:\Sigma_\rho\times\bI\to\C\)
   \begin{equation*}
   F(z,t)=z^n+\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(1-t)a_iz^i
   \end{equation*}
   It's obvious that \(F:g|\Sigma_\rho\simeq f_\rho^n\) if we can show that the image of \(F\) is contained
   in \(\C-\{0\}\). that is, \(F(z,t)\neq0\). If, on the contrary, \(F(z,t)=0\)  for some \(t\in\bI\) and
   some \(z\) with \(\abs{z}=\rho\), then \(z^n=-\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(1-t)a_iz^i\). The triangle inequality gives
   \begin{equation*}
   \rho^n\le\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(1-t)\abs{a_i}\rho^i\le\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\abs{a_i}\rho^i\le\left(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\abs{a_i}\right)\rho^{n-1}
   \end{equation*}
   for \(\rho>1\) implies that \(\rho^i\le\rho^{n-1}\). Canceling \(\rho^{n-1}\) gives \(\rho\le\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\abs{a_i}\),
   a contradiction.

   Assume now that \(g\) has no complex roots. Define \(G:\Sigma_\rho\times\bI\to\C-\{0\}\) by
   \(G(z,t)=g((1-t)z)\). (Since \(g\) has no roots, the values of \(G\) do lie in \(\C-\{0\}\))
   Visibly, \(G:g|\Sigma_\rho\simeq k\), where \(k\) is the constant function at \(a_0\). Therefore \(g|\Sigma_\rho\) is
   nullhomotopic and by transitivity, \(f_\rho^n\) is nullhomotopic, contradicting the hypothesis.

   if \(\norm{x}=1/2\) then \(2-2\norm{x}=1\) and \(F(x/\norm{x},1)=c(x/\norm{x})=y_0\). The gluing
   lemma shows that \(g\) is continuous. Finally \(g\) does extend \(f\): if \(x\in S^n\),

   If \(f=(f_1,f_2):[0,1]\to X\subseteq\R^2\).  is a path with \(f(0)=(0,0)\) ,then \(f(t)=(0,0)\) for all \(t\)

   Suppose that \(f(t)\) is not always \((0,0)\). Removing an initial part of the interval and then
   rescaling if necessary, assuming that \(0=\sup\{t:f([0,t]=\{(0,0)\})\}\). By continuity of \(f_2\),
   there is a \(\delta>0\) s.t. \(\abs{f_2(t)}<1\) for all \(t<\delta\). Take \(0<t_0<\delta\) with \(f_1(t_0)>0\).
   By continuity of \(f_1\) and the intermediate value theorem, \([0,f_1(t_0)]\) is in the image
   of \(f_1\) restricted to \([0,t_0]\). Since \(f_2(t)=\sin(1/f_1(t))\) for all \(t\)
   with \(f_1(t)\neq 0\). It follows that \([-1,1]\) is in the image of \(f_2\) restricted
   to \([0,t_0]\), this contradicts \(t_0<\delta\).

   1. A space \(X\) is path connected iff every two constant maps \(X\to X\) are homotopic
   2. If \(X\) is contractible and \(Y\) is path connected, then any two continuous maps \(X\to Y\)
      are homotopic (and each is nullhomotopic)

   1. \(\Rightarrow\). Take two constants as initial point and end point.

   2. Suppose \(k:X\to X\) is a constant map.

      Then \(f\circ 1_X\simeq f\circ k\), and \(f\circ k\) is homotopic to any constant map. So \(f\) is homotopic to
      every constant map.

   connected, then contractibility of \(\bI\) implies that all maps \(\bI\to X\) are homotopic (Exercise

   #+END_theorem

   #+BEGIN_proof
   If \([f]\in\pi_1(X,x_0)\), define \(\pi_1(h)\) be \([f]\mapsto[h\circ f]\). Note that the composite \(h\circ f:\bI\to Y\)
   is defined, is continuous and is a closed path in \(Y\) at \(y_0\); thus \([h\circ f]\in\pi_1(Y,y_0)\).
   Also \(\pi_1(h)\) is well defined: if \(f\simeq f'\rel\dbI\), then \(h\circ f\simeq h\circ f'\rel\dbI\) (Exercise
   ref:ex3.1). If \(f\) and \(g\) are closed paths in \(X\) at \(x_0\), then evaluation of both
   sides shows that there is equality (not merely homotopy)
   \begin{equation*}
   h\circ (f*g)=(h\circ f)*(h\circ g)
   \end{equation*}
   it follows that \(\pi_1(h)\) is a homomorphism

   It is routine to check that \(\pi_1\) preserves composition and identities in \(\Top_*\),  so
   that \(\pi_1\) is indeed a functor.

   Finally, Exercise ref:ex3.1 shows that \(h\simeq k\rel\{x_0\}\) implies that \(h\circ f\simeq k\circ f\rel\dbI\)
   whenever \(f\) is a closed path in \(X\) at \(x_0\). Thus \([h\circ f]=[k\circ f]\) for all such \(f\);
   that is, \(\pi_1(h)=\pi_1(k)\)
