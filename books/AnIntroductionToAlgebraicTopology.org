* Introduction

** Notation
   \(\bI=[0,1]\).
   \begin{equation*}
   S^n=\{x\in\R^{n+1}\mid\norm{x}=1\}
   \end{equation*}
   \(S^n\) is called the *\(n\)-sphere*. \(S^n\subset\R^{n+1}\) (\(S^1\) is the circle); 0-sphere \(S^0\)
   consists of the two points \(\{-1,1\}\) and hence is a discrete two-point space. We may
   regard \(S^n\) as the *equator* of \(S^{n+1}\)
   \begin{equation*}
   S^n=\R^{n+1}\cap S^{n+1}=\{(x_1,\dots,x_{n+2})\in S^{n+1}:x_{n+2}=0\}
   \end{equation*}
   The *north pole* is \((0,0,\dots,0,1)\in S^n\); the *south pole* is \((0,0,\dots,0,-1)\). The *antipode*
   of \(x=(x_1,\dots,x_{n+1})\in S^n\) is the other endpoint of the diameter having one endpoint \(x\); thus
   the antipode of \(x\) is \(-x=(-x_1,\dots,-x_{n+1})\), for the distance from \(-x\) to \(x\) is 2.
   \begin{equation*}
   D^n=\{x\in\R^n\mid\norm{x}\le 1\}
   \end{equation*}
   \(D^n\) is called the *\(n\)-disk* (or *\(n\)-ball*).  Observe that \(S^{n-1}\subset D^n\subset \R^n\);
   indeed \(S^{n-1}\) is the boundary of \(D^n\) in \(\R^n\)
   \begin{equation*}
   \Delta^n=\{(x_1,\dots,x_{n+1})\in\R^{n+1}:\text{ each }x_i\ge 0\text{ and }\sum x_i=1\}
   \end{equation*}
   \(\Delta^n\) is called the *standard \(n\)-simplex*. \(\Delta^0\) is a point, \(\Delta^1\) is a closed
   interval, \(\Delta^2\) is a triangle (with interior), \(\Delta^3\) is a (solid) tetrahedron, and so on.

   There is a standard homeomorphism from \(S^n\) - {north pole} to \(\R^n\), called *stereographic
   projection*. Denote the north pole by \(N\), and define \(\sigma:S^n-\{N\}\to\R^n\) to be the intersection
   of \(\R^n\) and the line joining \(x\) and \(N\). Points on the latter line have the
   form \(tx+(1-t)N\), hence they have coordinates
   \((tx_1,\dots,tx_n,tx_{n+1}+(1-t))\). The last coordinate is zero for \(t=(1-x_{n+1})^{-1}\); hence
   \begin{equation*}
   \sigma(x)=(tx_1,\dots,tx_n)
   \end{equation*}
   where \(t=(1-x_{n+1})^{-1}\). It is now routine to check that \sigma is indeed a homeomorphism. Note
   that \(\sigma(x)=x\) iff \(x\) lies on the equator \(S^{n-1}\)

** Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem
   #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
   #+BEGIN_theorem
   Every continuous \(f:D^1\to D^1\) has a fixed point
   #+END_theorem

   #+BEGIN_proof
   Let \(f(-1)=a\) and \(f(1)=b\).If either \(f(-1)=-1\) or \(f(1)=1\), we are done. Therefore we
   may assume that \(f(-1)=a>-1\) and that \(f(1)=b<1\) as drawn.

   If \(G\) is the graph of \(f\) and \Delta is the graph of the identity function, then we must prove
   that \(G\cap\Delta\neq\emptyset\). The idea is to use a connectness argument to show that every path in \(D^1\times D^1\)
   from \(a\) to \(b\) must cross \Delta.

   Since \(f\) is continuous, \(G=\{(x,f(x)):x\in D^1\}\) is connected (continuous image of connected
   space is connected). Define \(A=\{(x,f(x)):f(x)>x\}\)  and \(B=\{(x,f(x)):f(x)<x\}\). Note
   that \(a\in A\) and \(b\in B\), so that \(A\neq\emptyset\) and \(B\neq\emptyset\). If \(G\cap\Delta=\emptyset\), then \(G\) is the disjoint
   union of \(A\) and \(B\).

   #+BEGIN_theorem
   If \(f:D^n\to D^n\) is continuous, then there exists \(x\in D^n\) with \(f(x)=x\)

** Categories and Functors
   #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
   #+BEGIN_definition
   A category \(\calc\) consists of three ingredients: a class of *objects*, \(\obj\calc\); sets of
   *morphisms* \(\Hom(A,B)\), one for every ordered pair \(A,B\in\obj\calc\);
   *composition* \(\Hom(A,B)\times\Hom(B,C)\to\Hom(A,C)\), denoted by \((f,g)\to g\circ f\), for
   every \(A,B,C\in\obj\calc\) satisfying the following axioms
   1. the family of \(\Hom(A,B)\)'s is pairwise disjoint'
   2. composition is associative when defined
   3. for each \(A\in\obj\calc\) there exists an identity \(1_A\in\Hom(A,A)\) satisfying \(1_A\circ f=f\) for
      every \(f\in\Hom(B,A)\), all \(B\in\obj\calc\) and \(g\circ 1_A=g\) for every \(g\in\Hom(A,C)\), all \(C\in\obj\calc\)
   #+END_definition

   #+ATTR_LATEX: :options []
   #+BEGIN_definition
   Let \(\calc\) and \(\cala\) be categories with \(\obj\calc\subset\obj\cala\). If \(A,B\in\obj\calc\), let's denote the two
   possible Hom sets by \(\Hom_{\calc}(A,B)\) and \(\Hom_{\cala}(A,B)\). Then \(\calc\) is a *subcategory*
   of \(\cala\) if \(\Hom_{\calc}(A,B)\subset\Hom_{\cala}(A,B)\) for all \(A,B\in\obj\calc\) and if composition in \(\calc\) is
   the same as composition in \(\cala\)
   #+END_definition

   #+BEGIN_examplle
   \(\calc=\Top^{2}\). here \(\obj\calc\) consists of all ordered pairs \((X,A)\) where \(X\) is a topological
   space and \(A\) is a subspace of \(X\). A morphism \(f:(X,A)\to(Y,B)\) is an ordered
   pair \((f,f')\) where \(f:X\to Y\) is continuous and \(fi=jf'\) (where \(i\) and \(j\) are
   inclusions)
